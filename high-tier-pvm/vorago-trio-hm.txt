**__Introduction__**
Basing Trio Hard Mode is typically performed by a *Melee*. The Base Tank has several responsibilities, the most important being to apply the Statius's Warhammer swh4 special attack in **every** phase. Additionally you are expected to properly lure Vorago in phase 1 on the eastern wall so that the Climber (referred to as *Bomb Tank #2*) does not receive any Blue Bombs blue4.

.
**__Required__**
⬥ **Statius's Warhammer** (stored in an Essence of Finality eof4, you will be using at least 10 SWH specs per kill, this can be very costly otherwise)

.
**__Recommended__**
⬥ **Heightened Senses** heig4 (this relic is essential for approaching fast kills with advanced strategies)
⬥ **Stalling Abilities** - Refer to the official Rago Hub spreadsheet for advanced ability damage rotations: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7zscYcfJ9qXeIptQmXJiWUloalwDNtmxIOX7bqgkJg/edit?usp=sharing>

.tag:basep12
__**Base Tank - Phase 1**__
.tag:basep1
⬥ In phase 1 the Base Tank is responsible for luring Vorago in such a way that the top lure cannot receive Blue Bombs blue4. This also causes the Base Tank to receive Blue Bombs on top of melee Swipes swip4, therefore pray flicking between melee defme4 and magic defm4 is required. Additionally, when the kill timer reaches ~ 30 seconds, you must bring the boss close enough to the final platform of the climb, from where the Climber will voke voke4 Vorago into jump spot.

⬥ The easiest way to position correctly in the start is by *standing east of Vorago's spawn location*, tagging the boss, moving *two tiles to the east*, and finally *two tiles to the south*. By moving two tiles east, Vorago is far enough away from the Climber. Moving two tiles south and then attacking the boss causes you to face north-west, enabling the capability of simply surging :surge: north-west when it is time to take the boss closer to the Top Lure.

⬥ You should surge as the top lure is jumping the last ledge. Continue running to stall Vorago until the Top Lure vokes, then bladed dive bd4 south. Provoke Vorago, and wait for the Top Lure to jump.

⬥ One of the most important aspects of Phase 1 is to pay attention to Vorago's lifepoints - You do not want to deplete it too quickly, as you may accidentally reset the HP. Due to the ease of getting Vorago's HP low enough in time, you will generally have to slow your damage down intentionally before surging.

.
⬥ Phase 1 initial positioning

__**Base Tank - Phase 2**__
.tag:basep2
The Base Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to basing Normal Mode.

.
> **__Base Tank - Phases 3 - 8__** atk4
.tag:basep38
__**Base Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings**__ ceil4
.tag:basep3
⬥ **Strategy**
    • (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct nati4 in the end of Phase 2
    • Pre-Ultimate zerk4 as you drop into Phase 3
    • Drink from your Adrenaline Potion renew4
    • Place a Combat Dummy dummy4 in the start of the phase
    • Apply SWH swh4 as soon as possible

.
⬥ Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase.

⬥ If a Reflect refl4 occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack ioh4 sgb4 shortly after.

⬥ For slower teams you may also make use of your Limitless lim4 ability during Berserk zerk4.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__ scop4
.tag:basep4
The Base Tank has to lure all Scopuli scop4, in addition to hammering the eastern and northern Scopulus. A frequent usage of Vulnerability bombs vulnb4 is very useful for keeping up all Scopuli's stacked and aggressioned towards you, due to vuln bombs dragging Scopulus' aggro.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Stand directly west of the *western* Scopulus
    • Throw a Vulnerability Bomb vulnb4 3 - 4 seconds before Target Cycle to the *eastern* Scopulus's spawn location
    • Throw another bomb as soon as possible (after 3 ticks) directly under you in order to drag the *western* Scopulus's aggression
    • Attack both southern Scopuli with a few abilities gbar4 > assa4 first Scop > swh4 second Scop
    • As the northern Scopulus comes close enough, target, attack and voke voke4 it
    • Run directly south by a few tiles and back north, straight through the Scopuli scop4 (this should stack the Scopuli next to / on top of each other)

.
⬥ For slower phases you should utilize Devotion devo4 and eventually Reflect refl4.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__ obnox4
.tag:basep5
Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3 X (reference: <#802163727889072168>). All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick between melee deflme4 and magic deflm4. The Base Tank commonly takes the south-western corner in melee distance to Vorago.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-Ultimate zerk4 as you drop into Phase 5
    • Place a Combat Dummy dummy4 in the start of the phase
    • Apply SWH swh4 as soon as possible
    • Activate Limitless lim4 for this Berserk

.
⬥ Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3.

⬥ If a Reflect refl4 occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack ioh4 sgb4 shortly after.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__ gree4
.tag:basep6
At the beginning of the phase, it is recommended to voke voke4 Vorago and walk the boss far enough so that you will not be harmed by a mid mist, and can attack vorago from at least two different of the 9 grid arena sections of the arena.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Apply SWH swh4 as soon as possible

.
⬥ On this phase, you will simply be dumping thresholds. On target cycle, release your hammer with a bled assault and continue to thresh.

⬥ SGB sgb4 can be perfectly implemented in your pre-Reflect refl4 ability damage rotation.

⬥ If you receive a Green Bomb gree4, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality vit4 in order to easily survive it. If the Green Bomb is not on you, it is an optimal strategy to heal the respective Bomb Tank, shortly after they tanked the 10,000 detonation damage.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__ ts4
.tag:basep7
Similar to Phase 6, you will again only be hammering and thresholding.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Apply SWH swh4 as soon as possible (in Target Cycle)
    • Reprisal repri4 the first Team Split if you target cycled

.
⬥ There exist several **advanced** strategies. Based on your preference, you can either utilize your Adrenaline potion renew4 during Phase 7 to have adrenaline to Natty nati4 at the end of the phase, or perform a slightly less adrenaline-intensive rotation and save your the Apot for Phase 8.

.
__**Base Tank - Phase 8 The End**__ pb4
.tag:basep8
⬥ **Strategy**
    • (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct nati4 in the end of Phase 7
    • Pre-Ultimate zerk4 as you drop into Phase 8
    • (optional, if available) Drink from your Adrenaline Potion renew4
    • Place a Combat Dummy dummy4 in the start of the phase
    • Apply SWH swh4 as soon as possible (on Target Cycle)
    • (optional, if available) Activate Limitless lim4 for this Berserk

.
⬥ Fast teams should easily be capable of skipping this phase's Stand Up.

⬥ If a Stand Up is expectably happening, your team should tag either Red Bombs redb4 or Blue Bombs blue4, depending on what you agree on. This aspect is a responsibility of your Bomb Tanks and the Base Tank does not have to worry about it.

⬥ Drink a sip of the Powerburst of Vitality vit4 a few seconds after Stand Up. Alternatively, your bomb tanks may just choose to Barricade cade4 and Intercept cept4 on Stand Up, due to the relative ease of 0-linking this phase.

.
> __**Base Tank - Tips & Rotations**__ atk4
.tag:basetips
**__General Tips__**
⬥ The Statius's Warhammer swh4 special attack enables all following abilities in that tick cast by yourself with 100% hitchance

⬥ Following advanced ability rotations as provided on the Rago Hub spreadsheet

⬥ This includes pre-Berserk and pre-Barge rotations, or at a highest skill level utilizing Darkbow auto attacks for optimal adrenaline gain

⬥ Heightened Senses heig4 and Fury of the Small fots4 cause a drastic improvement for your Berserk zerk4 ability rotations, significantly more than Berserker's Fury dhfry4 would

⬥ Optimizing the usage of Natural Instinct

⬥ Remove the Mobile perk mob4 from your armour so that Surge, Escape and Bladed Dive generate adrenaline

⬥ Disruption Shield disr4 should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5, during first TS P7 and before P8 Stand Up

⬥ Greater Fury gfur4 the Combat Dummy dummy4 in the start of P7 (since you are not pre-Barging)

⬥ Take Crackling crac4 off for Reflects refl4 and end of P2 / P9

**__Introduction__**
Bomb Tanking at Trio Hard Mode can be performed in several setups. This section focuses Ranged, covering both Bomb Tank's responsibilities: Bomb Tank #1 and Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber). If you are Ranged bomb tanking with a Hybrid on your team, read up on both this and the Hybrid section. This guide section also covers strategies for approaching Double Ranged bomb tanking in Trio Hard Mode.

.
**__Required__**
⬥ **Mechanised Chinchompas** chin4 for Scopulus Phase 4
⬥ Up to 4 **Combat Dummies** dummy4

.
**__Recommended__**
⬥ **Heightened Senses** heig4
⬥ **Ruby, Onyx and Hydrix bakriminel bolts** ruby4 onyx4 hydr4

__**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 1**__
.tag:rangep1
⬥ It is always recommended to have one Bomb Tank ranging in Trio Hard Mode, who will pre-Ultimate swift4 start of Phase 1 and deal damage to Vorago, referred to as Bomb Tank #1. The other Bomb Tank is responsible for Climbing and Top Luring :maulpiecea:, also referred to as Bomb Tank #2.

⬥ A simple Death's Swiftness standard rotation should be enough to bring Vorago's lifepoints low enough before the Climber jumps. Your Ultimate should be placed right in melee distance, west of Vorago's spawn location. This position should provide you 100% uptime of your Ultimate for most locations that Vorago is lured to. Slow down dealing damage as Vorago reaches 50,000 HP and off early enough to avoid a reset.

⬥ If the Base Tank receives the second Red Bomb redb4 (random), you should cast Heal Other heal4 to support the Base Tank's food management.

.
⬥ Phase 1 initial positioning

__**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 2**__
.tag:rangep2
⬥ The Bomb Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to bomb tanking Normal Mode.

⬥ Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over Barricading cade4 and intercepting cept4 the first and third Red Bomb redb4. The Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts the second one.

.
⬥ You should have one person dedicated to shattering shtr4 the end of Bring Him Down (preferably the Ranger).

⬥ One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy dummy4 during Bring Him Down.

.tag:rangep38
__**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings**__ ceil4
.tag:rangep3
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-ECB ecb4
    • Dump SGB sgb4 and thresholds

.
⬥ Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase.

⬥ If a Reflect refl4 occurs in this phase, it is highly recommended to utilize Devotion devo4 and intercept cept4 the other Bomb Tank.

⬥ If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke voke4 Vorago as he jumps for the first time.

.
__**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__ scop4
.tag:rangep4
Your Base Tank is responsible for stacking all 3 Scopuli scop4. At times though, a Scopulus might reaggro to one of the Bomb Tanks. In this case: *run!* Make sure to stay at the outside of the arena in order to avoid passing any Blue Bombs blue4 to your Base Tank.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct nati4 in the end of Phase 3
    • Pre-Ultimate swift4 as you drop into Phase 4
    • BT#1 Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4
    • Equip Mechanised Chinchompas chin4 once the first 2 Scopuli are stacked up
    • If available, prioritize using the Darkbow dbow4 special attack (stored in EoF eof4) with Chins equipped
    • Drink from your Adrenaline Potion renew4 after your first Darkbow
    • Place a Combat Dummy dummy4 in the end of the phase (decide which of your Bomb Tanks)

.
⬥ The BT#1 utilizes Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4 on the other BT for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage. For slower phases, the other BT#2 should follow it up shortly after the first Devotion runs out.

*Note: Do __not__ use Vulnerability Bombs vulnb4 as Bomb Tank throughout Phase 4!*

.
⬥ The Ranged Bomb Tank should always take the southern position during P4, due to lower attack range of Ranged dual wield compared to Magic. Positioning for Bomb Tanks in Phase 4 Scopulus:

__**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__ obnox4
.tag:rangep5
Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3. All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick between melee deflme4 and magic deflm4. The Bomb Tanks commonly take the north-western corner and the eastern side in melee distance to Vorago.

*Note: In the start of the phase, you can position 1 tile out of melee distance, but be ready to step into MD as the Vitalis orb obnox4 explodes in order to avoid getting blocked or lost Line of Sight from spawned Vitali.*

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-ECB ecb4
    • Dump SGB sgb4 and thresholds

.
⬥ Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3.

⬥ If a Reflect refl4 occurs in this phase, it is best to Devotion devo4 or Reflect refl4 yourself, although it will mostly be on cooldown if you had a fast Phase 4.

⬥ If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is recommended to voke voke4 the start of Phase 5.

.
__**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__ gree4
.tag:rangep6
One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy dummy4 as you drop into the phase.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-ECB ecb4
    • Dump SGB sgb4 and thresholds

.
⬥ Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phases 3 and 5. This phase is significantly easier due to longer time until Reflect refl4 start.

⬥ If you receive a Green Bomb gree4, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality vit4 in order to easily survive it.

⬥ If a Reflect refl4 occurs in this phase, the Bomb Tank **who did not** receive the Green Bomb should Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4 the other one. You can also Resonance reso4 the first Blue Bomb after Reflect start safely, even with the caused defensive cooldown by a Green Bomb detonation.

⬥ If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke voke4 Vorago at the start of Phase 6.

.
__**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__ ts4
.tag:p7
One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy dummy4 as you drop into the phase.

*Note: Following a base guideline of abilities in this phase will significantly improve the overall outcome of Phase 7.*

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Tag on Target Cycle with a Snap Shot snap4 (quick hitting override required)
    • If you tagged on TC, reprisal repri4 right away (optional: sip of your Powerburst of Vitality vit4 if ready)
    • Activate ECB ecb4 special attack on this phase's Combat Dummy - Do not target the dummy until you activate Reprisal
    • (optional, but recommended) Disruption Shield disr4 during first the Team Split ts4
    • Dump SGB sgb4 and thresholds

.
⬥ If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke voke4 Vorago immediately after the first Team Split.

.
__**Ranged Bomb Tank - Phase 8 The End**__ pb4
.tag:rangep8
In Phase 8 there exist different strategies (beginner & advanced).

.
⬥ **Beginner Strategy (Recommended)**
    • Dump SGB :SerenGodbow: and thresholds
    • BT#1 tags all Blue Bombs blue4 and BT#2 Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4
    • Ultimate swift4 between third and last quadrant
    • Utilize your Adrenaline Potion renew4

.
⬥ **Beginner Strategy (Safe)**
    • Dump SGB sgb4 and thresholds
    • Each Bomb Tank tags 2-3 Red Bombs redb4 (avoid increased damage by one BT positioning at the outside, the other surging to the following quadrant **asap**)
    • BT#1 Ultimate swift4 between third and last quadrant
    • BT#2 Barricade Intercept cade4 cept4 on Stand Up

.
⬥ **Advanced Strategy**
*Note: This strategy is only recommended to very experienced teams and highly discouraged to use for beginner/intermediate teams.*
    • Use Natural Instinct nati4 in the end of Phase 7
    • Pre-Ultimate swift4 as you drop into Phase 8
    • Drink from your Adrenaline Potion renew4
    • Tag on Target Cycle with a Snap Shot snap4 (quick hitting override required)
    • Utilize ECB ecb4 and SGB sgb4 for first quadrant
    • Dump everything and aim for killing it before the 3rd quadrant

*Note: If your Death's Swiftness happens to not be placed in the first or second quadrant of Vorago's arms, you should move to the second quadrant, even if you have to leave your ultimate for it. Otherwise you are very likely to die due to suffocation damage.*

.tag:rangetips
**__General Tips__**
⬥ If performing the BT#2 role, transfigure trans4 for the 14k entry hit

⬥ Stalling abilities is sometimes easier by mouse clicking a dummy placed far away from your drop location and far-casting an ability, instead of equipping Excalibur excal4

⬥ Disruption Shield disr4 should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5, during first TS P7, after tagging bombs P8

⬥ Stay MD +1 in the start of P5 obnox4 until Reflect refl4

⬥ Take Crackling crac4 off for Reflects and end of P2 / P9

⬥ Remove the armour piece with Mobile mob4 for Escape / Surge / Bladed Dive generating adrenaline

⬥ Heal Other heal4 your Base Tank in P1 if they receive the Red Bomb redb4 and end of P2, P3, P4, P6 and P7

⬥ Rather skip Natty nati4 than nattying too late

⬥ Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase. Executing a stable Metamorphosis ability damage rotation will increase the consistency of 0-linking Phase 3.

⬥ If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke voke4 Vorago as he jumps for the first time.

.
__**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__ scop4
.tag:magep4
Your Base Tank is responsible for stacking all 3 Scopuli scop4. At times though, a Scopulus might reaggro to one of the Bomb Tanks. In this case: run! Make sure to stay at the outside of the arena in order to avoid passing any Blue Bombs blue4 to your Base Tank.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-Ultimate sun4 as you drop into Phase 4
    • (BT #1) Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4
    • If Greater Chain gcha4 is unlocked, follow it up with a Guthix Staff gstaf4 special attack early in the phase (the Greater Chain buff applies the Guthix Staff affinity stacks and defence drain to all targets)
    • Prioritize AOE damaging abilities and 4taa
    • Detonate as soon as all 3 Scopuli are stacked up
    • Place a Combat Dummy dummy4 in the end of the phase (decide which of your Bomb Tanks)

.
⬥ The Bomb Tank #1 utilizes Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4 on the other BT for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage. For slower phases, the other BT#2 should follow it up shortly after the first Devotion runs out.

*Note: Do __not__ use Vulnerability Bomb vulnb4 as Bomb Tank throughout Phase 4!*

⬥ If you 0-linked Phase 3, your Sunshine sun4 will be on cooldown for Scopulus. Simply dump Thresholds and Guthix Staff special attacks.

__**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__ obnox4
.tag:magep5
Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3. All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick for melee swipes swip4 and Blue Bombs blue4. The Bomb Tanks commonly take the north-western corner and the eastern side in melee distance to Vorago.

*Note: In the start of the phase, you can position 1 tile out of melee distance, but be ready to step into MD as the Vitalis orb obnox4 explodes in order to avoid getting blocked or lost Line of Sight from spawned Vitali.*

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-Detonate deto4
    • Dump Thresholds

.
⬥ Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3.

⬥ If a Reflect refl4 occurs in this phase, it is best to Devotion :Devotion: or Reflect refl4 yourself, although it will mostly be on cooldown if you had a fast Phase 4.

.
__**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__ gree4
.tag:magep6
One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy dummy4 as you drop into the phase.

⬥ **Straetgy**
    • (optional, advanced) Use Natural Instinct nati4 in the end of Phase 5
    • Pre-Ultimate sun4 start of Phase 3
    • Drink your Adrenaline Potion renew4
    • Pre-Detonate :Detonate: and make use of SGB ioh4 sgb4 pre-link
    • (BT #1) Devotion Intercept :Devotion: cept4 start of Reflect refl4

.
⬥ Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phases 3 and 5. This phase is significantly easier due to longer time until Reflect refl4 start. If you are going for fast phases, you should skip your Apot renew4 in this phase and save it for Phase 8 instead.

⬥ If you receive a Green Bomb gree4, simply drink a sip of your Powerburst of Vitality vit4 in order to easily survive it.

⬥ If a Reflect refl4 occurs in this phase, the Bomb Tank **who did not** receive the Green Bomb should Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4 the other one. You can also Resonance reso4 the first Blue Bomb after Reflect start safely, even with the caused defensive cooldown by a Green Bomb detonation.

⬥ If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke voke4 Vorago at the start of Phase 6.

.
__**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__ ts4
.tag:magep7
One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy dummy4 as you drop into the phase.

*Note: Following a base guideline of abilities in this phase will significantly improve the overall outcome of Phase 7.*

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-Detonate deto4 and tag on Target Cycle with an Auto Deto GStaff blbrg4 deto4 gstaf4 eof4
    • If you tagged on TC, reprisal repri4 right away (optional: sip of your Powerburst of Vitality vit4 if ready)
    • (optional, but recommended) Disruption Shield disr4 during first the Team Split ts4
    • Dump thresholds

.
⬥ If your team consists of a Hybrid Bomb Tank, it is very important to voke voke4 Vorago immediately after the first Team Split.

.
__**Magic Bomb Tank - Phase 8 The End**__ pb4
.tag:magep8
In Phase 8 there exist different strategies (beginner & advanced).

.
⬥ **Beginner Strategy (Recommended)**
    • Dump thresholds
    • BT#1 tags all Blue Bombs :BlueBomb: and BT#2 Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4
    • Ultimate sun4 between third and last quadrant
    • Utilize your Adrenaline Potion renew4

.
⬥ **Beginner Strategy (Safe)**
    • Dump thresholds
    • Each Bomb Tank tags 2-3 Red Bombs redb4 (avoid increased damage by one BT positioning at the outside, the other surging to the following quadrant **asap**)
    • BT#1 Ultimate sun4 between third and last quadrant
    • BT#2 Barricade Intercept cade4 cept4 on Stand Up

.
⬥ **Advanced Strategy**
*Note: This strategy is only recommended to very experienced teams and highly discouraged to use for beginner/intermediate teams.*
    • Pre-Metamorphosis meta4 as you drop into Phase 8 (drink from your Adrenaline Potion renew)
    • Pre-Detonate deto4 and tag on Target Cycle with an Auto Deto GStaff blbrg4 deto4 gstaf4 eof4
    • Release a stalled Wild Magic with a 2hit Asphyxiate, followed up by an SGB spec (your Ingenuity of Humans will eventually be on cooldown from Phase 6)
    • You can dump everything and aim for killing it before the 3rd quadrant.

.
> __**Magic Bomb Tank - Tips & Rotations**__ mag4
.tag:magetips
**__General Tips__**
⬥ Detonate deto4 should be pre-charged in most phases, as charging it during Reflects would cause Detonate to be on cooldown for the following phase

⬥ Use Barrage as primary spell, Blitz might be nulled by Reflect refl4 (also P4 Scopulus benefits heavily from Barrage)

.
**__Introduction__**
A general Hybrid setup for Trio HM consists of Melee atk4 as primary and either Ranged rng4 or Magic mag4 as secondary combat style. Magic is recommended due to the naturally increased hitchance on Scopuli scop4. At the current unbalanced state of combat styles, there exists only one method of making Hybrid effective over a double Ranged Bomb Tank setup. Hybridding is only recommended if your goal is improved kill speed, as your team is a lot more likely to lose a kill.

⬥ It is highly discouraged to take a BoB familiar (Mammoth scrolls with Soups :SailfishSoup:), due to the lost accuracy from a Nihil familiar already making Ranged a better choice over Hybrid. Therefore a Hybrid setup ends up having a very small amount of food (1 - 3 inventory slots). The selected aura should be Berserker :berserkeraura:.

⬥ In phases 1, 2, 4 (Scopulus) and 9 the Hybrid Bomb Tank uses the secondary combat style, Ranged or Magic.

⬥ Throughout phases 3 - 8 (excluding Scopulus P4) Melee is to be used. A primary portion of these phases will require you (the Hybridder) and the Base Tank to *step under* Vorago, with the BT#1 voking :Provoke: the boss.

⬥ Depending on the outcome of your Phase 10, you will either camp Melee for the start of P11 or switch to your secondary combat style immediately during phase transition.

.
⬥ As Hybrid Bomb Tank you will be the one climbing in Phase 1.

.tag:hybridp12
__**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 1**__
.tag:hybridp1
⬥ Generally speaking, a Hybrid Bomb Tank takes over the BT#2 responsibilities. The other Bomb Tank #1 ultimates Phase 1 while the Hybridder climbs.

⬥ Equip your secondary combat style for the Phase 1 to allow for tagging from the final platform of the Top Lure.

.
__**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 2**__
.tag:hybridp2
⬥ The Bomb Tank's responsibilities throughout Phase 2 are not any different to bomb tanking Normal Mode.

⬥ Usually the Bomb Tank #2 (the Climber) takes over Barricading :Barricade: and intercepting :cept~1: the first and third Red Bomb :redbomb~1:. The Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts the second one.

⬥ You should have one person dedicated to shattering :Shatter: the end of Bring Him Down (preferably the Ranger).

.
*Note: Due to lacking inventory space as a Hybridder, it is recommended to have either the Base Tank or the Bomb Tank #1 take an additional Combat Dummy dummy4. One Bomb Tank is assigned to placing a Combat Dummy dummy4 during Bring Him Down (preferably the BT#1).*

.tag:hybridp38
__**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 3 Ceilings**__ ceil4
.tag:hybridp3
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Use Natural Instinct nati4 in the end of Phase 2
    • Pre-Ultimate zerk4 as you drop into Phase 3
    • SGB ioh4 sgb4 post-Reflect refl4

.
⬥ Your team should simply aim for 0-linking the phase. It is very important for the Bomb Tank #1 to voke :Provoke: Vorago as he jumps away.

.
__**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 4 Scopulus**__ scop4
.tag:hybridp4
Your Base Tank is responsible for stacking all 3 Scopuli scop4. At times though, a Scopulus might reaggro to one of the Bomb Tanks. In this case: run! Make sure to stay at the outside of the arena in order to avoid passing any Blue Bombs blue4 to your Base Tank.

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-Ultimate sun4 as you drop into Phase 4
    • Prioritize AOE damaging abilities and 4taa
    • Detonate as soon as all 3 Scopuli are stacked up
    • Utilize Limitless lim4 for this Sunshine

.
⬥ Place a Combat Dummy dummy4 in the end of the phase (preferably the BT#1).

⬥ The Bomb Tank #1 utilizes Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4 for the second or third Blue Bomb in order to avoid taking too much damage. For slower phases, the Hybridder should follow it up shortly after the first Devotion runs out.

.
*Note: Do __not__ use Vulnerability Bombs vulnb4 as Bomb Tank throughout Phase 4!*

__**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 5 Vitalis**__ obnox4
.tag:hybridp5
Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 5 similar to a fast Duo Normal Mode Vitalis Phase 3. All players stay in melee distance and must pray flick for melee swipes swip4 and Blue Bombs blue4. The Hybridder commonly takes the north-western corner in melee distance to Vorago, with the BT#1 standing on the east side (opposite of L-Rock).

.
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-Ultimate zerk4 as you drop into Phase 5
    • Drink from your Adrenaline Potion renew4

.
⬥ Fast teams should simply aim for 0-linking the phase, just like Phase 3.

⬥ If a Reflect refl4 occurs in this phase, it is best to utilize your Seren Godbow special attack ioh4 sgb4 shortly after.

⬥ It is recommended to have your team's Bomb Tank #1 voke voke4 Vorago throughout Phase 5 in order to allow for both the Base Tank and the Hybridder to step under from the opposite side.

.
__**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 6 Green Bomb**__ gree4
.tag:hybridp6
⬥ **Strategy**
    • ZGS spec zgs4 as you drop into Phase 6
    • Implement an SGB spec ioh4 sgb4 in your P6 ability rotation pre-Reflect refl4

.
⬥ If the Hybridder or the Base Tank receive a Green Bomb gree4, it will be bridged multiple times. A 0-link in this phase is basically guaranteed.

⬥ It is recommended to have your team's Bomb Tank #1 voke voke4 Vorago throughout Phase 6 in order to allow for both the Base Tank and the Hybridder to step under.

.
__**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 7 Team Split**__ ts4
.tag:hybridp7
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Pre-Ultimate zerk4 shortly before Target Cycle (optimally 2 GCDs prior, to allow for a stalled basic released with another basic on TC)
    • Utilize Limitless lim4 for this Berserk

.
⬥ It is recommended to have your team's Bomb Tank #1 voke :Provoke: Vorago immediately after the first Team Split ts4 in order to allow for both the Base Tank and the Hybridder to step under.

.
__**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Phase 8 The End**__ pb4
.tag:hybridp8
⬥ **Strategy**
    • Dump thresholds (pre-Barge with Mobile mob4 to allow for a double Greater Barge rotation)
    • SGB spec sgb4 in the first quadrant

.
⬥ If a Stand Up is expected to happen, have the other Bomb Tank #1 tag all Red Bombs and then Barricade Intercept cade4 cept4 on stand. The Hybridder should pre-Ultimate zerk4 for Stand Up.

.
> __**Hybrid Bomb Tank - Tips & Rotations**__ atk4 rng4 mag4
.tag:hybridtips
**__General Tips__**
⬥ Transfigure trans4 for the 14k entry hit

⬥ DBow autos

⬥ Disruption Shield disr4 should be used during P2 BHD, end of P3, end of P4 / start of P5 and during first TS P7

⬥ Step under for phases 5, 6 and 7

⬥ Take Crackling crac4 off for Reflects and end of P2 / P9

⬥ Do not use the Mobile perk mob4 on your armour directly and put it on your Excalibur excal4 instead

⬥ Heal Other heal4 end of phases P3, P4, P6 and P7

⬥ Rather skip Natty nati4 than nattying too late

.tag:weekly
**__Introduction__**
Trio Hard Mode approaches Phase 9 similar to Duo / Trio Normal Mode Phase 4. The person barricading cade4 last on P9 should be the person that does not barricade start of P10.

Phases 10 and 11 vary the most, relying on the same factors as described in the intro to this Trio Hard Mode guide: Weekly changing special mechanics, several combat style compositions and an individually varying player skill level. This section of the guide will cover 2 basic guidelines of strategies for differently approaching phases 10 and 11: Safe vs Advanced.

.
**__Safe Strategies__**
A stable order of Ultimates and Barricades for consistently finishing a Trio Hard Mode kill fast with safe strategies.

.
**__Advanced Strategies__**
Powercreep goes brrrrrr. Essentially simply follow the Rago Hub spreadsheet ability damage rotations.

.
> __**Safe Phases 10 & 11**__
.tag:safety
**__Phase 10__**
⬥ Base Tank and Bomb Tank #2 Ultimate zerk4 swift4 sun4 start of Phase 10

⬥ Bomb Tank #2 Barricade Intercept cade4 cept4 timings
    • Ceilings ceil4 / Team Split ts4 - First auto attack after Team Split
    • Scopulus scop4 / The End pb4 - Third auto attack
    • Vitalis obnox4 - First auto attack or before Vitalis orb explosion (depending on what happens first)
    • Green Bomb gree4 - Barricade only if the Green Bomb targets someone else (Vitality vit4 if on BT#2)

.
⬥ Refer to this illustration for a general overview of alternative maul timings:
.
.img:https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/676485011268042761/802173025252016128/maulguide.PNG
.
⬥ If you miss the optimal opportunity of mauling, continue through Vorago's mechanics and maul at alternative maul timings, as stated in the weekly mechanic channels. If you go through another whole cycle of mechanics, the Bomb Tank #1 cade cepts cade4 cept4 at the same time as the BT#2 did in the start of P10.

⬥ One of the Bomb Tanks is usually assigned to placing a Combat Dummy dummy4 in the end of P10 (shortly before maul). This dummy must be placed in the east and you have to be distanced at least 1 tile to the southern wall. The Base Tank shouldalways maul with a prior cast Shield Dome dome4!

*Note: Ranged Bomb Tanks should apply BSA bsa4 throughout phases 10 and 11 to compensate for decreased hitchance once the Base Tank's SWH swh4 spec runs out.*

.
**__Phase 11__**
⬥ Base Tank Ultimate zerk4 whenever it is ready

⬥ Bomb Tanks switch Barricade Intercept cade4 cept4 and Ultimates swift4 sun4 rotationally

.
**__Bomb Tanks Cade Cept / Ultimate Timings__**
*Note: Assume BT#2 caded last on Phase 10.*

.
⬥ **Ceilings** ceil4
    • BT#1 cade cept either after Team Split ts4 or start of Reflect refl4
    • BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second Team Split throughout P11

.
⬥ **Scopulus** scop4
    • BT#1 cade cept either the third auto attack after Purple Bomb pb4 release or start of Reflect refl4
    • BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second cycle of Purple Bomb / Reflect throughout P11

.
⬥ **Vitalis** obnox4
    • BT#1 cade cept either the first auto attack after Bleeds dismem4 or the Vitalis orb obnox4 explosion
    • BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second cycle of Bleeds

.
⬥ **Green Bomb** gree4
    • BT#1 cade cept once the Green Bomb gree4 chose its target (if a Bomb Tank is targeted and neither cade cept nor Vitality vit4 is available, the Base Tank should cade cept or the other Bomb Tank utilizes Devotion Intercept devo4 cept4)
    • Rotationally repeat cade cepts for every Green Bomb and keep track of cooldowns (Vitality, Barricade, Devotion)

.
⬥ **Team Split** ts4
    • BT#1 cade cept after Team Split ts4 or start of Reflect refl4
    • BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second Team Split throughout P11

.
⬥ **The End** pb4
    • BT#1 cade cept either start of Reflect refl4 or the Vitalis orb obnox4 explosion
    • BT#2 ultimate and thresh, build to cade cept for the second Reflect

.
> __**Advanced Phases 10 & 11**__
.tag:advanced
Approaching phases 10 and 11 in advanced teams is independent of weekly mechanics.

.
**__Overview__**
⬥ In Phase 10 you always aim for 0-speccing (get to maul maul4 before the spec release, e.g. Purple Bomb pb4 or Vitalis orb obnox4). This is achieved by pushing consecutively every 3 ticks for 8 tiles from Target Cycle on. Once you reached maul spot, you wait for the spec to release and maul right after.

⬥ If Phase 10 was executed correctly, Phase 11 should always start with 3 auto attacks (5 if first P10 spec is Green Bomb gree4 or Purple Bomb pb4) into the second spec of P11.

.
**__Rotations__**
For optimal execution of phases 10 and 11 simply refer to the Rago Hub spreadsheet:
